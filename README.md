Its more like a crud APP in jsp and servlet and MySql database.

This project follow MVC architecture just to make it oraganized. 

In this small project one can understand how MVC design pattern works and how the real life projects are carried out.

Here we can add some details to the database and retrieve that whenever required. 

Can edit the infromation.

Can delete the infromation.

I have also maintained the session after login and destroying session after logout.

View Part is build using Java Server Pages(JSPs)

Servlet as Controller classes which process the business logic.

Model classes are fairly POJO which hold the raw data.
